# double_pendulum-euler-s-method-
This is my repository intented for my double pendulum simulation code.

I used the Euler's method to implement the physics and math behind this simulation. Using my physics knowledge, I derived the necessary equations I have to implement for the project to work. 

I used python in this project, and learned pygame from the scratch.
